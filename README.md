JsonSharp

This is a wrapper around a previous json parser I wrote a while back, except I added reflection and improved the usability.
C# 4.0 is recommended but not required.

**Compiling Instructions: **

***csc: ***

`csc /t:library json.cs json2.cs`
*Compile project with csc: *

`csc /r:(DLLNAME).dll (FILE1, FILE2, ...)`
